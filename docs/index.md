# Welcome to Winpin

An online UWindsor events platform where you can participate in events as well as create engaging virtual events. 

## Vision
The goal of this project is to design an Event Management portal “Winpin”, that allows users to participate in events and create engaging virtual events. The event portal will allow users to keep track of the different events, the schedule, the organizers and the overview of the events. The Organizers should be able to login to the system as an administrator to add and modify the events and view/edit participant list.
